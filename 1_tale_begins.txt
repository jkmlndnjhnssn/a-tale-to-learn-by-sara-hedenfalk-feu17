A lonely couple, who want a child, live next to a walled garden belonging to an evil witch 
named Dame Gothel. The wife, experiencing the cravings associated with the arrival of her 
long-awaited pregnancy, notices some rapunzel (or, in most translated-to-English versions[9]
 of the story, rampion), growing in the garden and longs for it, desperate to the point of death. 
One night, her husband breaks into the garden to get some for her. She makes a salad out of 
it and greedily eats it. It tastes so good that she longs for more.
