Together they plan a means of escape, wherein he will come each night 
(thus avoiding Dame Gothel who visits her by day), and bring Rapunzel 
a piece of silk, which she will gradually weave into a ladder. 
Before the plan can come to fruition, however, she foolishly gives 
him away. In the first edition of Grimm's Fairy Tales, she innocently 
says that her dress is getting tight around her waist (indicating pregnancy); 
in the second edition, she asks Dame Gothel (in a moment of forgetfulness) 
why it is easier for her to draw up the prince than her.[10] In anger, 
she cuts off Rapunzel's hair and casts her out 
into the wilderness to fend for herself.
