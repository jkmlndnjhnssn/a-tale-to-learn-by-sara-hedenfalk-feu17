One day, a prince rides through the forest and hears Rapunzel singing from the tower. 
Entranced by her ethereal voice, he searches for her and discovers the tower, 
but is naturally unable to enter it. He returns often, listening to her beautiful 
singing, and one day sees Dame Gothel visit, and thus learns how to gain access to Rapunzel. 
When Dame Gothel leaves, he bids Rapunzel let her hair down. When she does so, 
he climbs up and they fall in love. 
He eventually asks her to marry him, which she agrees to.
The prince had a smart horse who is stubborn, but brave as him.
