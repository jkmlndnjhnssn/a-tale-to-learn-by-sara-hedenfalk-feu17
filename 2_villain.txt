Dame Gothel is described as an evil witch who lives in a walled garden beside a lonely couple whose window looks over the garden. 
Her garden is described as the envy of all others, constantly healthy with many vegetables and flowers in perfect bloom.
When her prized rapunzel plant (or, in most translated-to-English versions of the story, rampion) 
is stolen by the man to feed his pregnant wife, Dame Gothel captures him the second time and accuses him of theft.
Gothel has a magical wand which is in herited from her grandmother, the evil witch.
