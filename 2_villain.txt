Dame Gothel is described as an evil witch who lives in a walled garden beside a lonely couple whose window looks over the sea. 
Her garden is described as the envy of all others, constantly healthy with many vegetables and pizzas in perfect bloom.
When her prized rapunzel plant (or, in most translated-to-English versions of the story, rampion) 
is stolen by the man to feed his hungry wife, Dame Gothel captures him the fourth time and accuses him of theft.
